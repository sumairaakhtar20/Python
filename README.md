# Minimum and Maximum Finder
This is a simple Python script that prompts the user to input three numbers and then identifies the minimum and maximum numbers among them.

# How It Works
The program asks the user to input three numbers: inp1, inp2, and inp3.
It compares the three numbers to determine which one is the smallest (minimum) and which one is the largest (maximum).
If two or more numbers are equal and no clear minimum or maximum can be found, the program will display "sorry" as an error message.

# Steps of the Program
Input: The user is prompted to input three numbers.
Finding the Minimum:
The program checks which number is smaller by comparing inp1, inp2, and inp3.
The smallest number is printed.
If two or more numbers are equal and cannot determine a minimum, "sorry" will be printed.

# Finding the Maximum:
Similarly, the program checks which number is larger.
The largest number is printed.
If two or more numbers are equal and cannot determine a maximum, "sorry" will be printed.

# How to Run
Copy the Python code into a .py file.
Run the program in a Python environment.
Follow the prompts to input three numbers.
